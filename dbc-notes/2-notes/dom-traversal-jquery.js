// always check element inspector to make sure you're appending to the correct place
  // just bc its kind of showing up right, doesn't mean it always will 
  // CHECK EVERYTHING!!!!!!!!!!

// choose as close as possible so event doesn't 

// closest vs parent
  // find goes down
  // closest goes up
  // parent ---> ah why did i get distracted 
  // parent is more fragile, if dom changes the relation will break 
  // closest will be MUCH more stable

// prioritize separating stuff out into vars

// testing if found or not=
if(($thing).length == 0) {
  console.log("not found")
}

// keeping code try
//keep parts that are the same for statements (if/else) outside of the case statement
